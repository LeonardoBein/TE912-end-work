## Part 01: Theoretical

### 1) What is deep learning? 
  Deep learning can be defined as a type of machine learning where it's possible to learn by itself by many patterns in multiples processing layers,configured by basic parameters about the data base. Which means it's a learning algorithm with multiple levels of features that can leads to multiple levels of abstrations. It's largely used in big companies as Amazon, Google, Netflix, IBM.
